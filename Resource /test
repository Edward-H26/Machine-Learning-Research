This question pertains to drawing students at random from a class of **10 boys and 10 girls**. **Six of the girls** and **two of the boys are blonde**. The rest of the students not blonde.

Draw one student at random. **What is the probability that the student is either a girl *or* blonde?**

[numeric]{text: 'P(Girl or Blonde):', relativeError: 0.001}
```py solution
12/20
```
```md explanation
It can be very helpful to draw a table when doing this problem to organize all of the information given.

There are 8 blondes, 10 girls, and 6 blonde girls. The problem presents us with an *or* statement so we use can use the Addition Rule to calculate the probability. We want to make sure to subtract the probability of getting a blonde girl so we aren't counting them twice. These events are not mutually exclusive. 

P(Girl <b>OR</b> Blonde)<br>
= P(Girl) + P(Blonde) - P(Blonde Girl)<br>
= ${10 \over 20}$ + ${8 \over 20}$ - ${6 \over 20}$<br>
= ${12 \over 20}$<br>
= <solution>0.6</solution>
